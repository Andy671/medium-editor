# Android Strings Text Editor

When writing content for my Android app in `strings.xml` I found that there is no built-in editor that supports `<b> <i> <u>` tags and `\n` symbol, where [Android Docs](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/string-resource.html) (*Styling with HTML markup* section) shows that it is possible to use them. 

That's why I hastily made this WYSIWYG helper-tool on top of [medium-editor](https://github.com/yabwe/medium-editor) as a fork of it.
